inspired in https://kata-log.rocks/manhattan-distance-kata

Manhattan distance is the distance between two points in a grid calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path. Write a function ´´int manhattanDistance(Point, Point)´´ that returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.

Rules
 - The class Point is immutable (its state cannot be changed after instantiation)
 - The class Point has no Getters
 - The class Point has no public properties (i.e. the internal state cannot be read from outside the class).
